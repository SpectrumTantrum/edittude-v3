# footage-inventory

Know the bin before you cut.

## Steps

1. `ls` the folder. Skip `artifacts/`, `dataset/`, `.edittude/`.
2. Run:

```
edittude-v3 media inventory FOLDER --out OUT/inventory.json
```

3. Read the JSON. Note video count, total seconds, fps/resolution mix, and any audio-only file that looks like voiceover or music. Read `display_width`/`display_height` for the frame as it plays: coded `width`/`height` are pre-rotation, so a portrait phone clip reports 1920x1080 with `rotation` ±90. That `rotation` field is iPhone display-matrix and ffmpeg applies it on decode. Do not transpose again. Note the orientation mix too, since the delivery canvas follows the dominant footage.
4. If you need eyes:

```
edittude-v3 media thumbs OUT/inventory.json --out OUT/thumbs
```

Completion: a written inventory, and thumbs if you could not name the coverage without them.
